# BIOSTAT 823-Final Project

This is the repository for BIOSTAT 823 final project.

### Reproduction instructions
In order to reproduce this project, an environment with GPU is recommended. 

Data used for the project is stored under [**00_Data**](https://github.com/tianyunh/BIOSTAT823-Project/tree/main/00_Data).

All the dependencies required are listed in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/tianyunh/BIOSTAT823-Project/blob/main/requirements.txt). The notebook to reproduce the project can be found under [**10_Code**](https://github.com/tianyunh/BIOSTAT823-Project/tree/main/10_Code) folder: [`Final_Project.ipynb`](https://github.com/tianyunh/BIOSTAT823-Project/blob/main/10_Code/Final_Project.ipynb). For the ease of reproducibility, I recommend using GoogleColab to run the notebook as all the dependecies are already pre-installed in Colab environment.

All the outputs from the notebook can be found under [**20_Results**](https://github.com/tianyunh/BIOSTAT823-Project/tree/main/20_Results).

Finally, the final report can be found [here](https://github.com/tianyunh/BIOSTAT823-Project/blob/main/30_Report/Final_Project_Report.pdf).
